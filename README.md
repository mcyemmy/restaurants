# Restaurants

### In this version 2 of the assignment/exam, I did the following:
- Completed the restaurant listing page and Map functionality on restaurant detail page
- Dist folder is included. I was able to VIEW the build(packed) version by running the http-server in dist/restaurants/.
- Or rather, you can install dependencies and run ng serve, then go to `http://localhost:4200/`.
- On the map/detail page, if you see `This page can't load Google Maps correctly`, just click ok and it will go away for you to see the restaurant's location identifier.
- You may click on the location identifier on the map to see the actual restaurant's address displayed on the map.
- Please let me know if there's any question at yemi.oteyowo@gmail.com
